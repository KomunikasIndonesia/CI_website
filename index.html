                    <h3>Current State</h3>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from Hutan Biru's sustainability program, the farmers return to their home villages, spread across the island
                        of South Sulawesi. The lack of technology, combined with lack of internet access and distance between
                        villages, impedes farmers' ability to share data, implement a production calendar, or interact with
                        their fellow graduates (now members of the HB Network) outside of their home village. Thus, in it’s current state,
                        membership within the HB Network provides virtually no benefits and members, and they remain unable
                        to coordinate or scale their production, share resources, leverage collective bargaining power, or
                        learn from the successes of their peers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The farmers in the HB Network do not have acess to internet, but they do have SMS capable phones, so we have developed an innovative
                        solution that uses only the basic cell phones they already posses. By parsing SMS texts, the cloud
                        based app instantly connects the farmers to life changing technology.

                        The cloud based app allows farmers to log, store, own and selectively share information. It empowers the farmers to track crop yields and prices, set seasonal harvest goals, share successful farming strategies, receive weather updates, and communicate with each other as well as their customers whether they be individuals, middle men, or private companies.

                        Because they can grant various levels of viewing and editing access to different users, the farmers can share their data selectively.

                                        Once there, Kat was tasked with answering the overwhelmingly broad question of how
                                        can we (the NGO) improve? She spent the majority of her summer asking the farmers
                                        what they needed to succeed. After numerous interviews, trips to the NGO's village
                                        sites, and administering surveys, it became clear that the biggest obstacle the farmers
                                        faced in their daily lives was a massive communication gap. At the end of her internship
                                        Kat presented her proposed solution to the farmers.</p>

                                        2 engineers, and a development sociologist, Kat and the team spent months researching
                                        how to best use farmers' cell phones to bridge the communication gap. Detailed plans
                                        for a robust, cloud based data sharing app were developed.</p>
